        This fettuccine dish topped with a creamy,
        cheesy Alfredo is a family favorite.
        It's great with a salad and garlic bread.
    </h5>
    <h3> Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>3 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Add onion, mushrooms, and remaining garlic; sauté until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add milk and half-and-half; cook and stir until smooth and creamy. Stir in both cheeses until melted.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken mixture, tomatoes, and sour cream. Serve over cooked fettuccini.</li>
