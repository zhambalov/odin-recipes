    <h3> Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups grated cauliflower</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup real bacon bits</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place grated cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high for 2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wring cauliflower in a clean dish towel, squeezing out as much moisture as possible. Transfer cauliflower to a large mixing bowl. Add Cheddar cheese, egg, bacon bits, chives, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Divide cauliflower mixture into 6 equal portions, making sure to leave space between each one. Flatten with your hands and shape into ovals.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Turn broiler on low and broil until crispy, about 5 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes to firm up.</li>
